Project Overview
================

This project intends to explore and define a modernization path
for a traditional ASP.NET 4.5 MVC application underpinned by a
SQL Server database, by achieving following goals:

- Target not only Windows, but also Linux, including Docker
containers and container orchestrators like Kubernetes.
- Make it compatible with PostgreSQL open-source database, to
enable usage of scalable could-based PostgreSQL as a service.
- Eliminate dependencies on components requiring proprietary
licenses.
- In the future, replace relational database with an eventually
-consistent, highly scalable cloud data store.
